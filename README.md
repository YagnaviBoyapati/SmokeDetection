This project presents a custom Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) designed for smoke detection using IoT sensor data in a monitored environment. The RNN model is built from scratch, emphasizing optimization for accuracy and scalability. During the testing phase, MapReduce framework is employed for parallelized evaluation, ensuring efficient processing of the RNN model on a large-scale dataset. The project's evaluation metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the RNN model in smoke detection tasks.
